# mslicediffraction
Basic multislice implementation to generate diffraction patterns for custom objects and single (or small set) probe.
Input structure as a .mat file can be made from .xyz or .mslice file using separate python code.
Multislice is done interactively in MATLAB using potentials from Advanced Computing... by EJ Kirkland.
