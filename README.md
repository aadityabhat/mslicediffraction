# mslicediffraction
Basic multislice implementation to generate diffraction patterns for custom objects and single (or small set) probe.
Input structure as a .mat file can be made from .xyz file using separate python code.
Multislice is done interactively in MATLAB using potentials from Advanced Computing in Electron Microscopy by EJ Kirkland with gaussian blurring based on DWF.

To use: 
1. Download all to a folder
2. Open multislice.mlx in MATLAB
3. Change MATLAB working directory (left panel) to folder
4. Run all or individual sections
